The only way to do that in P55 (using packages and all that) is by doing Java and using the P55 core library.<br />\nI&#8217;m still fascinated by strange attractors and since my old P55 attractor viewer was made in P55 alpha, and there are all these useful libraries for the latest P55, I decide to rebuild it.<br />\nSo I fired up Eclipse and after I while had a really cool new version in which you can create and save attractor data to cookies, render and save <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/sjeiti/sets/72157603957488195/\">images</a> directly. And the standalone version even renders out <a href=\"/48-hours-of-rendering\">complete movies</a> (thanks to <a href=\"http://processing.org/reference/libraries/video/index.html\">this cool lib</a>).<br />\nAll was going well until I started testing online. Somewhere in my code was a memory leak. I&#8217;m not that experienced with Java and/or Eclipse (yeah I do my as3 in some simple text editor because I can&#8217;t get used to Eclipses lack of features like vertical selection or keystroke recording). So I spend ages trying to find that leak, read a lot on garbage collection, changed a lot of code, but it still leaks after a while. In the end I just gave up on it, which is a pity because I had all these other cool ideas to implement.<br />\nBut yesterday I thought: what the hell, I&#8217;ll post this anyway, leak or no leak. It&#8217;s no use hiding in my test folder. You can still use it to render very cool images. Just remember: when the framerate slows down, save your attractor, close the page, reload it, and load your attractor again.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m gonna quit ranting, here it is: <a href=\"http://attractors.ronvalstar.nl/\">Attractors rebuild</a>.</p>\n",

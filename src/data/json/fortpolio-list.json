A strange attractor is not complicated, but because it is deterministic it needs a few billion iterations for a proper result. September last year Chrome dropped support for Java applets. Since Javascript has come a long way I thought I&#8217;d try a remake in Nodejs. I compared a rough to a client-side implementation and found the speed difference negligible enough to bring the entire implementation to client-side Javascript.<br />\nContrary to the old Java applet <a href=\"http://attractors.ronvalstar.nl\" target=\"_blank\">this Javascript version</a> can burp out animated gifs and webm videos.</p>\n","dateFrom":"2016-03-04","dateTo":"2016-07-14","featured":true,"inCv":true,"inPortfolio":true,"thumbnail":"https://ronvalstar.nl/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/attractors01-150x150.jpg","images":["https://ronvalstar.nl/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/attractors00-768x432.png","https://ronvalstar.nl/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/attractors01-768x432.jpg","https://ronvalstar.nl/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/attractors02-768x432.jpg","https://ronvalstar.nl/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/Lorenz-84-52.gif","https://ronvalstar.nl/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/Lorenz-84-31.gif","https://ronvalstar.nl/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/Lorenz-84-57-768x432.png"],"tags":[274,289,218,235,250,297,317],"categories":[273,30,278,285]},{"slug":"strange-attractors","title":"Strange attractors","excerpt":"","content":"<p>This side project started of in Processing but soon grew into a Java project.
